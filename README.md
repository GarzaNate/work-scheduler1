# I created a page where users can see an accurate clock, and a color coded scheduler for the regular hour of a work day. The users are able to enter an edit in each time block and submit the text. This project was difficult and frusturating because it took me forever to get moment.js to work and display on the screen. I was also having trouble with the color changing background based on the time of the day. I was not able to finish this project, I was still planning on using local storage so the edits a user makes would be saved throughout the day.
